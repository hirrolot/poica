## Features
 - C11-compliant
 - Can work on bare-metal environments
 - Comes with the [specification]
 - No third-party code generators, just `#include <poica.h>` and go!

[specification]: https://github.com/hirrolot/poica/wiki/Specification

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hirrolot/poica.git
cd poica
```

The only dependency is [Boost/Preprocessor]. If you are on a UNIX-like system, just run the following script:

```
sudo bash scripts/install_boost_pp.sh
```

Alternatively, [Boost/Preprocessor] can be downloaded and then installed from its [official releases](https://github.com/boostorg/preprocessor/releases).

Since poica is a header-only library, feel free to copy necessary files to your project and `#include <poica.h>` to export its API (using the `-I` compiler option). That's all.

## Motivation

Usually in C we use unions to tell a compiler that we're going to interpret a single memory region in different ways. To decide how to interpret a union, we endow it with a tag and get a [tagged union].

However, there'll be quite lot of duplication in code:

```c
typedef struct {
    enum {
        OUR_TAGGED_UNION_STATE_1,
        OUR_TAGGED_UNION_STATE_2,
        OUR_TAGGED_UNION_STATE_3,
    } state;

    union {
        int state_1;
        const char *state_2;
        double state_3;
    } data;
} OurTaggedUnion;
```

What's even worse is that this approach is unsafe, meaning that we can construct invalid `OurTaggedUnion` (i), or, for example, (ii) access `data.state_1` when the actual state is `OUR_TAGGED_UNION_STATE_3`:

```c
// (i)
OurTaggedUnion res1 = { .state = OUR_TAGGED_UNION_STATE_2, .data.state_1 = 123 };

// (ii)
OurTaggedUnion res2 = { .state = OUR_TAGGED_UNION_STATE_3, .data.state_3 = .99 };
some_procedure(res2.data.state_1);
```

poica solves these two problems by introducing [algebraic data types] (discussed in the next section). That's how it's accomplished with poica:

```c
ENUM(
    OurTaggedUnion,
    VARIANT(MkState1 OF int)
    VARIANT(MkState2 OF const char *)
    VARIANT(MkState3 OF double)
);

// (i) Compilation failed!
OurTaggedUnion res1 = MkState2(123);

OurTaggedUnion res2 = MkState3(.99);
some_procedure(/* Impossible to pass state_1! */);
```

## ADTs

[**ADT**s (**A**lgebraic **D**ata **T**ypes)] provide a convenient approach to combine, destruct, and introspect data types. There are two main kinds of them: **sum types** and **product types**.

Simply put, a **sum type** is _either_ of `T1`, ..., `Tn`, and a **product type** is _both_ `T1`, ..., `Tn`. Another name of sum types is a [tagged union], and product types correspond to structures in C.

[Pattern matching] is checking each variant of a sum type, and, if a matched variant is an actual one, trigger some action. They are like `if` statements, but for sum types, rather than for boolean expressions.

### Sum types

For example, a [binary tree] like this:

[binary tree]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MkefQNV.png" width="380px" />
</div>

Can be conveniently represented as a sum type and further manipulated using pattern matching. In the code below we first construct this binary tree, and then print all its elements to `stdout`:

[[`examples/binary_tree.c`](examples/binary_tree.c)]
```c
#include <poica.h>

#include <stdio.h>

ENUM(
    Tree,
    VARIANT(MkEmpty)
    VARIANT(MkLeaf OF int)
    VARIANT(MkNode OF MANY
        FIELD(left OF struct Tree *)
        FIELD(number OF int)
        FIELD(right OF struct Tree *)
    )
);

void print_tree(const Tree *tree) {
    MATCH(tree) {
        CASE(MkEmpty) {
            return;
        }
        CASE(MkLeaf, number) {
            printf("%d\n", *number);
        }
        CASE(MkNode, MANY(left, number, right)) {
            print_tree(*left);
            printf("%d\n", *number);
            print_tree(*right);
        }
    }
}

#define TREE(tree)                OBJ(tree OF Tree)
#define NODE(left, number, right) TREE(MkNode(left, number, right))
#define LEAF(number)              TREE(MkLeaf(number))

int main(void) {
    const Tree *tree =
        NODE(NODE(LEAF(81), 456, NODE(LEAF(90), 7, LEAF(111))), 57, LEAF(123));

    print_tree(tree);
}

#undef TREE
#undef NODE
#undef LEAF
```

<details>
    <summary>Output</summary>

```
81
456
90
7
111
57
123
```

</details>

### Product types

If we have structures in C, why do we need product types? Well, because product types provide type introspection (discussed in the next section). A product type is represented like this:

```c
RECORD(
    UserAccount,
    FIELD(name OF const char *)
    FIELD(balance OF double)
    FIELD(age OF unsigned char)
);
```

And it can be further manipulated like an ordinary structure:

```c
UserAccount user = {"Gandalf", 14565.322, 715};
user.name = "Mithrandir";
user.age++;
user.balance *= 2;
```

## Type introspection

[Type introspection] is supported in the sence that you can query the type properties of ADTs at compile-time and then handle them somehow in your hand-written macros.

### Sum types

[[`examples/introspection/enum.c`](examples/introspection/enum.c)]
```c
#include <poica.h>

#include <stdio.h>

#include <boost/preprocessor.hpp>

#define MY_ENUM                                                             \
    Something,                                                             \
    VARIANT(MkA)                                                           \
    VARIANT(MkB OF int)                                                    \
    VARIANT(MkC OF MANY FIELD(c1 OF double) FIELD(c2 OF char))             \

ENUM(MY_ENUM);
#define Something_INTROSPECT ENUM_INTROSPECT(MY_ENUM)

int main(void) {
    puts(BOOST_PP_STRINGIZE(Something_INTROSPECT));
}

```

<details>
    <summary>Output</summary>

```
((POICA_VARIANT_EMPTY)(MkA))
((POICA_VARIANT_SINGLE)(MkB)(int))
((POICA_VARIANT_MANY)(MkC)( ((c1)(double)) ((c2)(char)) ))
```

</details>

### Product types

[[`examples/introspection/record.c`](examples/introspection/record.c)]
```c
#include <poica.h>

#include <stdio.h>

#include <boost/preprocessor.hpp>

#define MY_RECORD                                                             \
    Something,                                                                 \
    FIELD(a OF int)                                                            \
    FIELD(b OF const char *)                                                   \
    FIELD(c OF double)                                                         \

RECORD(MY_RECORD);
#define Something_INTROSPECT RECORD_INTROSPECT(MY_RECORD)

int main(void) {
    puts(BOOST_PP_STRINGIZE(Something_INTROSPECT));
}
```

<details>
    <summary>Output</summary>

```
((a)(int)) ((b)(const char *)) ((c)(double))
```

</details>

That is, the metainformation about types is actually a [sequence] in the terms of [Boost/Preprocessor]. So the [`BOOST_PP_SEQ_*` macros] can be used further, as well as [other utility macros](https://github.com/hirrolot/poica/wiki/Specification) from poica.

With type introspection it is possible to achieve [type-driven (de)serialization], [declarative command-line arguments parsing], the [decorator pattern] and more such things.

### Real-world usage

### Safe, consistent error handling

ADTs provide a safe, consistent approach to error handling. A procedure that can fail returns a enum type, designating either a successful or a failure value, like this:

```c
ENUM(
    RecvMsgErrKind,
    VARIANT(MkBadConnection)
    VARIANT(MkNoSuchUser)
    ...
);

ENUM(
    RecvMsgRes,
    VARIANT(MkRecvMsgOk OF char *)
    VARIANT(MkSendMsgErr OF RecvMsgErrKind))
);

RecvMsgRes recv_msg(...) { ... }
```

And then `RecvMsgRes` can be matched to decide what to do in the case of `MkRecvMsgOk` and `MkSendMsgErr`:

```c
RecvMsgRes res = recv_msg(...);
MATCH(&res) {
    CASE(MkRecvMsgOk, msg) { ... }
    CASE(MkSendMsgErr, err_kind) { ... }
}
```

But why this is better than `int` error codes? Because of:

 - **Readability.** Such identifiers as `MkRecvMsgOk` and `MkSendMsgErr` are more for humans, and therefore, it's much harder to confuse them with each other. In contrast to this, the usual approach in C to determine an error is by using magic ranges (for example, <0 or -1).

 - **Consistency.** No need to invent different strategies to handle different kinds of errors (i.e. using exceptions for less likely errors, `int` codes for a normal control flow, ...); ADTs address the problem of error handling generally.

 - **Exhaustiveness checking (case analysis).** A smart compiler and static analysis tools ensure that all the variants of `RecvMsgRes` are handled in `MATCH`, so we can't forget to handle an error and make a possibly serious bug by leaving an application work as there's no error, when there is.

ADTs even have advantages over exceptions: they do not perform transformations with a program stack, since they are just values with no implicit logic that can hurt performance.

See [`examples/error_handling.c`](examples/error_handling.c) as an example of error handling using ADTs.


### Message passing, tokens, AST, ...

ADTs have tremendous amount of applications to real-world programming. For example, it's very naturally to [encode tokens](examples/tokens.c) as a sum type, [pass messages](examples/message_passing.c) from one process to another, [evaluate an AST](examples/ast.c).

## FAQ

Q: What "poica" means?

A: "poica" is a [Quenya] word, which means clean, pure. It reflects its API.


[Quenya]: https://www.ambar-eldaron.com/telechargements/quenya-engl-A4.pdf

Q: Are these macros zero-cost?

A: poica has no runtime and performs no system calls, the macros expand to plain C code. Here are the disassembled versions of the examples:

| Example | Link |
|--------|-------|
| `ast.c` | https://godbolt.org/z/BHQEog |
| `binary_tree.c` | https://godbolt.org/z/5XKjVu |
| `tokens.c` | https://godbolt.org/z/pNx4jX |
| `error_handling.c` | https://godbolt.org/z/6Kotvn |

Q: Any pitfalls?

A: The only pitfall I discovered so far is scary macro errors, describing consequences, not causes. However, in user code they can be solved by just carefully looking at line numbers that trigger an error.

Q: Why they are called algebraic?

A: Read ["The algebra (and calculus!) of algebraic data types"](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/three/algebra-and-calculus-of-algebraic-data-types) by [Joel Burget](https://codewords.recurse.com/about#Joel%20Burget).

Q: Is it allowed to use [Boost/Preprocessor] in C?

A: Yes.

Q: Why did you created this project?

A: Initially poica was born as my experiment of what's possible in plain C.
